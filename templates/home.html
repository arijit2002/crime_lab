        <h1>Indian Crime Data Analysis</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          A detail analysis and visualization of the crimes committed.
          The crime rate is ever-growing and so is technology. We thought of combining them to produce meaningful insights. Though, there is a plethora of work on London & Chicago crime analysis but few on Indian records. So, we found a data-set from <a href="https://data.world/bhavnachawla/crime-rate-against-children-india-2001-2012">data.world</a> for this study. The objective of this project is to find out which state has the highest crime rate and which is the crime that is committed. Without further ado, let’s get started.

        <h1>Crime in India</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Crime in India has been recorded since the British Raj, with comprehensive statistics now compiled annually by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), under the Ministry of Home Affairs (India) (MHA). Crime is a very old concept and it is transmitted to the society from generation to generation. Crime produces law and order situation. It is a social evil. It is generated by the society and the society also suffers a lot because of crime committed by its members. The rising wave of crime to-day has caused alarm any the public.
            <br>
            Nobody is safe to-day. The world is full of criminals and criminal activities are on the rise through out the world to-day. With the development in science and technology criminals are using scientific techniques while committing the crime and police has been baffled by the techniques used.
            <br>
            The peace and happiness of the society is disturbed because of constant and continuous operation of criminals. When criminals are not punished they are encouraged to do more crime. Particularly in this age of wide scale unemployment educated and uneducated youths commit crime for easy money.
            <br>
            Many crimes are committed for money, property wealth and disputes within the family for distribution of property. A son kills his father, a brother assaults his brother or a brother in law murders his sister in law and her minor children.
            <br>
            In every society there are some accepted patterns of behaviour approved by the society and culture. In order to lead a harmonious life following the approved patterns of behaviour certain rules, laws and regulations are framed.
            <br>
            Any body who violates these rules is said to commit a crime. In India now crimes are so rampant that in one hour about 187 cognizable crimes under IPC and 443 crimes under the local and special laws are committed.
            <br>
            According to the reports by crimes of India (1994) in one day, the police nabs 832 thefts, 258 riots, 66 robberies and 333 burglaries and 2991 other criminal offences.
            <br>
            Crimes of India further reports that between 1953 and 1983 the crimes in India had rose from 6.09 lakh to 13.49 lakh i.e., in 30 years a rise of 116 percent or 2.2 times, while between 1984 and 1994 crime increased from 13.59 lakh to 16.35 lakh i.e., the crime increased by 25 percent.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In India, between 2001 and 2011, the ”Asian Center for Human Rights” reported a total of 48.338 cases of the rape of minors, with an increase of 336%: from 2,113 cases in 2001 to 7,112 cases in 2011.
            In 2017, the WHO estimated that up to 1 billion minors between the ages of 2 and 17 years of age have endured violence either physical, emotional, or sexual. Sexual abuse (from groping to rape), according to some UNICEF estimates from 2014, affected over 120 million children, representing the highest number of victims.

        <h1>Word of Caution</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Crime is manifestation of myriad complex factors. The causes of criminal 
            behavior lie in the social processes and structures. People commit crimes due to the 
            process of socialization that does not develop strong sense of right or wrong and due 
            to the emerging opportunities, the enlarging desires that act as strong motivation for 
            taking to crime to fulfill these desires. The genesis of crime can be traced to interplay 
            of various social, economic, demographic, local and institutional factors. The 
            presumption that crime occurs because of the failures of police therefore displays a 
            complete lack of understanding of the theories of criminal behavior. 
            Further, these social factors along with other latent and concomitant factors 
            vary significantly across different regions, states and societies. The differences in 
            procedures over large geographical regions and styles of functioning inherent 
            between organizations also create wide variances. Hence, doing comparison among 
            States/districts/regions/social groups etc. on the basis of these published data alone 
            will be too simplistic and is best avoided. 
            Further, no weightage has been assigned to the gravity or nature of the crime. 
            All crimes have thus been treated equal in counting the total crime for a State or City. 
            More crime registered say, in a city is, therefore, not an indicator of its being 
            comparatively unsafe than the city where total crime may be less. 
            Lastly, as crime increases with population, Crime per lakh population (Crime 
            Rate) may be a better indicator to assess increase or decrease in crime. However, a 
            word of caution here! The primary presumption that the upward swing in police data 
            indicates an increase in crime and thus a reflection of the ineffectiveness of the police 
            is fallacious. ‘Rise in crime’ and ‘increase in registration of crime by police’ are 
            clearly two different things, a fact which is often confused. Thus an oft-repeated 
            expectation from certain quarters that an effective police administration will be able 
            to keep the crime figures low is misplaced. Increase in crime numbers in a State 
            police data may in fact be on account of certain citizen centric police initiatives, like 
            launching of e-FIR facility or women Helpdesks, etc. The increase or decrease in 
            crime numbers, however, does call for a professional investigation of underlying 
            factors jointly with local communities to suitably address the issues involved
